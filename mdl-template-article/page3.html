        <p>Step 1:First begin by loosening the wheel-bolts with the tire iron by turning iron counter clockwise.Do not remove bolts completely</p>
        <p>Step 2:Insert the car jack underneath the carjack point making sure it lines up with groove from jack. Insert the jack lever and raise the car but turning lever clockwise.</p>
        <p>Step 3:Once the car is lifted off the ground, continue to unbolt the nuts the rest of the way and pull of the tire by pulling towards yourself.</p>
        <p>Step 4:Put the replacement tire on the car and secure it with the bolts. Screw bolts on with the tire iron in order to hold tire in place</p>
        <p>Step 5: Lower the car by turning the jack counter clockwise until the car is on the ground</p>
        <p>Step 6:Tighten the wheel by turning the iron clockwise. Tighten one bolt at a time in an "X" direction</p>
